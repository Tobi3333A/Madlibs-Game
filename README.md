# MADLIBS Game
This is a game that creates a sentence or story based on user input. This project was to test my basic JavaScript skills in web dedvelopment.
## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
## How It Works
Users are asked basic questions. The system stores the answers to those questions and uses those answers to form a story at the end of the game. It's not compulsory for the story to have a complete meaning; it's just for fun!
